Welcome to Proximo.

This program is a proxy solution for MySQL that enables you to munge your
database connections in all sorts of strange and interesting ways.

This software is released under the same terms as Perl itself.  Please see
the LICENSE file for more information.  Parts of the technology used inside
(notably the protocol we speak) is copyright MySQL AB.

I have used various places as inspiration for this project.  The MySQL
Proxy project, Dormando's Proxy for MySQL, and DBIx::MyServer.  The code
organization and design patterns in use are based on the design that was
evolved for the Perlbal project.

Author is Mark Smith <mark@xb95.com> ... please find on the Perl or Freenode
IRC networks as xb95 or email me with any questions.

For usage information, well, read the source.  We don't have any documents
yet... :-)

Enjoy!
