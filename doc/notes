just doodling some config ideas for various setups...

# setup a master-master setup, this could technically have as many
# masters as you want.  with this setup, queries will only go to one
# machine from the list, if that machine goes down then we will start
# sending queries to a different machine and stop using the first one.
 
create mysql cluster mymastermaster
  setup = all-master
  masters = x:a, y:b, z:c
  behavior = one-at-a-time

# or you could say to split traffic among the databases...

  behavior = split

# but if you wanted to define a master/slave setup, you could do something like
# this... which drives traffic to your slaves, and writes to the master.  note
# that we are not including the master for reads.  which is something you might
# want to do if you have only a single slave, for example.

create mysql cluster mymasterslave
  setup = master-slave
  master = x:a
  slaves = y:b, z:c
  behavior = split
  include_master_for_reads = no

# what are some other setups?  a ring topology?  well, in that case it's
# kind of all masters...
